In full fullfilment of the Requirement for the degree of the open data science online masters


I've already completed a lot of this content. But I'd like to get the rest out of the way. I think it's important.

To supplement the projects I'm working on in AI and ML/DL I'm going to take this data science masters online course. Hopefully it expands on the skills that I need to know and allows me to become a better person. If it translates into skills that are better applicable to a career in ML/DL/AI/Data Science, great. If not, then it just makes me better on my own, so I'll be better for it, which is the whole point of everything isn't it? 

Anyways, I'll be using this progress MD file as a progress tracker to show what in the curriculum I am working on and what I need to work on. I will also be posting notes, projects, etc from the course to prove that I actually ran through everything and didn't just fork the course and copy/paste it. I'll be doing this course along with the Udacity AI course and hopefully they will supplement eachother.

So let's get started:

As of 6/4/2017 Andy Miller has completed:
(An asterisk denotes that I need to review the content. I will remove the askerisk when I complete everything)

-Linear Algebra (Khan Academy)
-Linear Algebra (Stanford Book)
-Linear Programming, Math 407 (University of Washington) *
-The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra
-The other items in the Linear Algebra are covered in the previous coursework.
-Convex Optimization (Stanford) *

So, that's all I've completed so far. If anyone is reading this, if anyone ever reads this, my progress beyond this point is stuff I actually did. If the content above has the asterisks removed, it means I completed all coursework and reviewed all of the material. Everything below has been completed or read by me, Andy Miller. I will try to get this done in 6-9 months. If anything comes of this, it was worth it.
